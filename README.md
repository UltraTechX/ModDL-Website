ModDL is created by UltraTechX to try and make modded servers more of a norm, since over the years since modding became a thing
I have not seen anything like this appear to make more specialized servers that are not just locked to plugin-based servers like bukkit or spigot.
I played around with v2016 and v2017, but with v2019 things are different. Full webapp for managing collections, decked out with API keys, 
OAuth 2.0 authentication for google and twitch, and a modern, easy-to-use website. ModDL is the new age for modding and modded servers.
